The VST3 SDK is licensed by Steinberg Media Technologies and is proprietary software.
For this reason, the files are not provided in this repository. You'll need to
download the SDK [here](http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html) and
save a copy of it in this directory. Or, you can save the SDK different location
on your computer and update the path used by the `VST_SDK` variable in the
`Makefile`.
